## üöÄ Code Files & Descriptions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `AlternativePrime.java`

* **Description:**
  Reads an array of integers, splits them into primes and non-primes, and calculates the **minimum penalty** by summing the extra elements needed to make the sequence alternate between prime and non-prime numbers as closely as possible.
* **Highlights:**

  * Prime detection.
  * Sorting and balancing lists.
  * Shows how to build minimal adjustment logic for alternating patterns.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `Anagram.java`

* **Description:**
  Checks whether the input string can be rearranged to form a **palindrome** (i.e., at most one character can have an odd count).
* **Highlights:**

  * Frequency counting of characters.
  * Simple anagram-based palindrome test.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `PalindromeConversion.java`

* **Description:**
  For a given number, repeatedly reverses and adds it to itself until the result becomes a **palindrome**, then prints that palindrome.
* **Highlights:**

  * Recursive implementation.
  * Palindrome check using string reversal.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `PrimeFactorSum.java`

* **Description:**
  Finds and sums all **distinct prime factors** of the input number.
* **Highlights:**

  * Efficient prime checking.
  * Demonstrates factoring logic.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `SubSequence.java`

* **Description:**
  Reads a sequence of integers and prints the count of **unique elements** using a `TreeSet`.
* **Highlights:**

  * Automatic sorting and deduplication.
  * Simple use of Java collections.

## ‚ö° Purpose

This repository serves as a set of small Java practice programs for:

* Strengthening basic algorithm skills.
* Demonstrating use of data structures like arrays, sets, and string builders.
* Preparing for interviews & coding rounds.
